# Google Data Analytics Project 
# How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?
For this project, I will perform the real-world tasks of a junior data analyst for the marketing team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago.


In this project, I have completed all phases of data analysis, which are: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.
The tools I used in this analysis:
* I did the data familiarization and cleaning using Microsoft Excel.
* I performed the research and data processing directly using Google BigQuery SQL.
* Data visualization was performed using Tableau.

In this analysis, I wanted to use as many basic tools as possible in practice, so the choice was exactly that.

## You can find my detailed analysis performed in this project in the attached file named 'artemenko.cyclistic_project.pdf'
